# Gallery app

In this app, you can search for whatever you want. You will see photos related to the word that you have chosen. After clicking on an image, it will appear in the middle of your screen in a bigger size. The app has pagination, so you can use the left and right buttons or select the particular page you want. I used Vue, Vite, Pinia, Vue Router and SCSS to build this app.
